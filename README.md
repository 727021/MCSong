MCSong
=============

MCSong is a server software for the once-popular "classic" version of Minecraft and for [Classicube](https://www.classicube.net/). It is one of many softwares based on [MCLawl](https://github.com/727021/MCLawl), which was originally made by Lawlcat, Zallist, and Valek.

MCSong was started in June 2012, then scrapped and restarted in November 2014 after a long period of inactivity. It's now 2019, and MCSong hasn't had a major update in 5 years. Even though nobody plays Minecraft Classic/Classicube anymore (or uses MCSong), I've decided to start a complete rewrite of MCSong featuring full [CPE](http://wiki.vg/CPE) support, an improved GUI, plugin/extension support, and more. Overall, it will be an improved version of the MCSong that used to be. I will also start work on a new website/forum with a server list and a remote console. Watch this repository for changes/updates.
