=============

MCSong is a server software for the once-popular "classic" version of Minecraft. It is one of many softwares based on [MCLawl](https://github.com/727021/MCLawl), which was originally made by Lawlcat, Zallist, and Valek.

MCSong was started in June 2012, then scrapped and restarted, after a long period of inactivity, in November 2014. MCSong now features support for [Classic Protocol Extension](http://wiki.vg/CPE), which adds exciting new features to the game, and development is still going.
